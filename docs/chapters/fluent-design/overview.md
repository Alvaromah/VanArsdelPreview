# Fluent Design
## What's Fluent Design?
Fluent Design is an important aspect of any modern Windows 10 application. It's a new design language that sets the guidelines on how the User Interface of an application should look, interact and express in the Windows 10 ecosystem.
Some key aspects of Fluent Design are:
 -	The usage of **transparencies** with **blur effects** that blend naturally with the rest of the system.
 -	Usage of **lightning and shadow effects** that take part in user interactions
 -	**Depth**. Each of the elements of the user interface may be distributed as part of a 3D space, bringing the relevant content at a given time while its context remains behind, making it easier to the user to focus 
-	**Fluid and connected animations**. The elements of the user interface should act and animate and adapt to changes and act upon user interactions.
